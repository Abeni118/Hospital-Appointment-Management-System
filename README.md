# Hospital-Appointment-Management-System
## Project Overview

The Hospital Appointment Management System is an academic software engineering project developed to model and understand how appointment-related activities in a hospital environment can be managed using object-oriented principles and UML modeling techniques. The project focuses on system understanding, modeling, and structural code generation rather than full deployment or implementation.

## Problem Description

Hospitals commonly face challenges in managing patient appointments, doctor availability, and staff coordination when using manual or semi-digital systems. Appointment scheduling is often inefficient, leading to long waiting times, scheduling conflicts, poor communication between patients and medical staff, and difficulties in tracking appointment status. These issues reduce service quality and increase administrative workload.

## Rationale for Selecting the Problem

This problem was selected because appointment management is a critical function in healthcare systems and directly affects patient satisfaction and hospital efficiency. The problem is also well-suited for applying software engineering concepts such as object-oriented analysis, UML modeling, and system design. Addressing this problem allows the project to demonstrate real-world relevance while practicing structured system modeling and design techniques learned in the course.
